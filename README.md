# Codey’s Counting Game

## Overview  
**Codey’s Counting Game** is a browser-based game built using the Phaser.js framework in JavaScript. The purpose of the project is to give you practical experience with scene transitions, animations, sprite/tween effects, user interaction, and basic game logic — all wrapped in a simple game structure. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Why this matters / What you learn  
- How to use Phaser.js to build multi-scene games. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- How to implement animations, sprite handling, and tween effects for a more engaging user experience. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Basic JavaScript game development: user input, event handling, game logic, win/lose conditions, and scene management. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- A good foundation for building more complex games, or extending the game with new features like scoring, levels, UI, audio, etc.

## What this repo contains  
Typical files you might expect (or to add):  
- `index.html` — HTML entry-point that loads Phaser, game scripts, and assets.  
- A script folder (e.g. `src/` or `js/`) with JavaScript files such as:  
  - `game.js` — bootstraps Phaser, defines game config (canvas size, physics, scenes)  
  - `StartScene.js`, `GameScene.js`, `EndScene.js` — scene files handling different parts of the game (menu, gameplay, end screen). :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- Asset folder(s) — images / sprites / sprite-sheets / audio / any resources used for animation or game UI.  
- (Optional) README or documentation for assets / controls / license.

## Requirements / Dependencies  
To run or develop the project you’ll need:  
- A modern web browser (supports HTML5 + JavaScript)  
- Phaser.js (version consistent with project setup)  
- A simple HTTP server (if needed) — or just open `index.html` directly (depending on asset loading method)  
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and optionally CSS (if styling is added)
